## Overview
As a user, I want more info about a specified city, including a map,  weather, movies, events, and trails.

## Getting Started
Clone this repo: https://github.com/SianCulligan/lab-06-back-end


## Architecture
We built a location object and weather object that transverses difference Json files for information requested, that then passes it to the static front end.
